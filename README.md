# 👋 Hi, I’m Douglas Ronne

I’m a software engineer, mathematician, and builder of tools that make people more effective. Over the last two decades I’ve worked across embedded systems, CAD automation, manufacturing R&D, motor control, and productivity software. My work has ranged from **low-level embedded controllers** to **full CAD/ERP systems** used daily by engineers and manufacturers.

## 🧭 I am in the process of taking my github account from a place where toy projects lived into being a proper portfolio since most of my work has been for private companies. 
- I will create a brushless DC motor controller in Rust-embassy, C++ Baremetal, C++ freeRTOS, and Rust-TockOs or Rust-RedOx (both of which will require some hacking for real time interrupts). This is to answer the question whether there are significant costs to using rust. I keep hearing both that rust is better and rust is much worse but have yet to see evidence either way.

## 🚀 What I Do Best
- **Embedded Systems & Control** — from motor control to avionics, vision, sensor integration, and hardware debugging.  
- **Legacy & Modernization** — skilled in refactoring, test-driven development, and growing long-lived software without constant rewrites.  
- **CAD & Manufacturing Automation** — creator of flagship sheet-metal CAD software (~$5M annual revenue, 20% of new customers).  
- **Team Growth & Leadership** — grew R&D at one company from 1 to ~40, blending software, mechanical, and industrial engineering into high-performing teams.  
- **Problem Solving with Empathy** — I listen deeply to customers and colleagues to uncover real problems and craft practical solutions.

## 🌟 What Makes Me Different
- **Builder Mindset**: I thrive at the intersection of software and hardware, turning abstract code into real-world impact.  
- **Lifelong Learner**: From teaching university math to exploring new stacks like Rust and Kotlin Multiplatform, I’m always expanding my toolkit. Being open to what you do not know is the most important attribute of an engineer!  
- **Adaptive Leader**: Comfortable as both a hands-on engineer and a team builder who scales people, processes, and products.  
- **Communicator**: Easy to work with, skilled at smoothing relationships, and committed to team success over individual ego.
